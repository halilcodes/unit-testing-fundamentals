! CHAPTER -1

TYPES OF TESTING
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- System Testing
- User Acceptance Testing

* Unit Testing
Frameworks;
- unittest
    - in python standard library
    - we learn this one in this course
- pytest
    - additional package
- nose

Terminology; 
- Test case: single test case
- test suite: multiple test cases combines
- test runner: component to run test suite
- unit under test: code that is being tested
- test fixture: setup & tear down-- env setups etc.

** "python -m unittest test_calculator.py -v" is the command to run test (-v is for detailed view)
     you cannot run unittest purposed .py files in order to unit test

** "python -m unittest test_calculator.TestsCalculator2 -v" for specific class
** "python -m unittest test_calculator.TestsCalculator2.test_add_functionality2 -v" for specific method

PyCharm has a better user interface for unittest 
** TODO: read unittest documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
    - check assertNotEqual(a, b) etc.

! CHAPTER -2
@unittest.skip(msg) decorator skips given test and reports as skipped during testing
deleting "test_" in the brginning of function ignores test case

setup & tear down - text fixture:
- test_calculator_v3_04.py shows
- setUp() and tearDown() methods?
    - check test_car_v2.py VS test_car_c3.py to see what it does! 
    - used instead of if..else conditionals with unittest

developing test suite:
- test_calculator_v3_05.py shows
- not working on my machine... TODO: figure out why


! CHAPTER -3

test discovery:
"python -m unittest discover unit_testing_01 " 
TODO: documentation "discover"
